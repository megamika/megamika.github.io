            A lot of the enemies were designed with the purpose of encouraging

            Protector uses his shield a lot, which can be easily overcome by
            using your **fireball ability**, the scout dashes around a lot which

          together and test out the map from any room that you want. you are
          also able to quickly jump into the room editor to make tweaks to the
          room and then go back out.

          For the final game the level designer has created around 120 rooms in
          total and that created some technical and performance difficulties.
          Some things that were not a big deal with a smaller amount of rooms
          suddenly became a problem when the amount of rooms has expanded and
          the number of objects was increased.
        </span>
        <span class="omemory-v2-text56">
          A lot of the things used to run on tick (every frame, on update) and
          that was a huge problem for the performance, the game was then
          refactored to instead use events which dramatically improved the
          performance and loading times.

        <span class="omemory-v2-text57">
          The room editor was the editor that contained the most features, you
          could acess all of the assets relevant to level editing on the bottom,
          on the left there was a rudamentary hierarchy to show all the spawned
          items, you also had an ability to translate, scale and rotate any
          object.
        </span>
        <span class="omemory-v2-text58">
          The created room will then be saved as a JSON file and can be edited,
          shared and simply commited.

          For some objects (mostly the enemies) you also were exposed to some
          parameters. For example for the enemies in the game you had an ability
          to change which wave they would spawn at, if they are a boss or not
          (the health bar would appear in that case) and if they even count in
          the wave system.

            The game also gives the players a way to save progress and load up
            their save slot to continue playing. The game would automatically
            save each time you would reach a checkpoint or unlock a new ability.
